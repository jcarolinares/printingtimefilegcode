# printingtimefilegcode

This python script takes gcode files generated by Cura inside a directory and renames the files with the format: xxHxxM to know the estimated time of printing

Made by Julian Caro Linares: jcarolinares@gmail.com

This program can estimate the printint time (no generated cura gcode files) using the program gcoder.py that belongs to the project Printrun-More info at https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/blob/master/printrun/gcoder.py

You can also put the time after the name using the command "-after"

Example:

./printing_time_file.py -after /home/user
